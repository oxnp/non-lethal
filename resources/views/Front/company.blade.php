                <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
                <p style="font-size:17px;color:#474747">Founded by Florian (Flo) Loferer, Non-Lethal Applications is a
                    software development company based in
                    Southern Germany.</p>
                <p>Flo was looking for an affordable, professional and dependable video playback solution that could
                    work with popular DAWs like Pro Tools, Nuendo, Cubase, Logic and Studio One. He started to ask
                    composers and those working in post production what there was and soon found out that nothing
                    existed to meet his requirements.</p>
                <p>They say that necessity is the mother of invention and so with a book on Objective-C in one hand he
                    started to write code for the software he and others were looking for, that software was Video
                    Slave. He laughs now because he says the first versions he showed around studios did the job but in
                    his words 'were pretty ugly'. Thankfully that's no longer the case.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to today and Video Slave is now in its third version, of course Video Slave and it is
                    fast becoming the goto software for composers, producers, engineers and live producers for rock
                    solid synchronized video playback using MIDI.</p>
                <p>From humble beginnings Non-Lethal Applications have found fans in all sorts of places, with our
                    software being used on top movies, TV, commericals, live theater, opera, pop concerts, and in houses
                    of worship.</p>
                <p>Non-Lethal Applications also make iOS applications for use in studios.</p>
